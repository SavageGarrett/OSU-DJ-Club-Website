  "description": "There are lots of tools out there to learn how to DJ, but not all of them are great. We've put some of the most essential topics below to help get you up and running as smoothly as possible, along with some tutorials we've written ourselves. We've also included more intermediate and advanced resources for those further ahead.\n\nStill confused or want to know more?
